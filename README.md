# Enhancing MRI Brain Tumor Classification: A Comprehensive Approach Integrating Real-Life Scenario Simulation and Augmentation Techniques

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

This study presents a comprehensive approach to enhancing MRI brain tumor classification by integrating real-life scenario simulation and augmentation techniques. The authors evaluated pre-trained deep learning models on a primary brain cancer MRI dataset ("BT-MRI" dataset), achieving high performance metrics. However, when tested on synthetic datasets (Challenging dataset) that mimic real-world complexities, the models' performance dropped significantly, highlighting the need for improved generalization.
